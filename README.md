# Modern Java Practices

This repository contains examples of how to use modern **Java** features, including **text blocks**, **records**, **streams**, **Optional**, **pattern matching**, and **type inference** with `var`.

## Features Covered
- **Text Blocks** (Java 13+): Simplifies writing multi-line strings such as JSON, SQL queries, and HTML.
- **Records** (Java 14+): A concise way to create immutable data classes.
- **Streams API**: Functional operations for collections like filtering, mapping, and collecting.
- **Optional**: Handling potential null values in a safer way.
- **Pattern Matching** (Java 16+): Enhances `instanceof` checks for cleaner code.
- **Type Inference with `var`** (Java 10+): Automatically infers the type of local variables.
- **Sealed Classes and Interfaces** (Java 17+) : Restrict the types that can extend or implement a class or interface, enhancing type safety.
- **Java Switch Expressions** (Java 14+): Enhances switch statements for cleaner code.
- **Lambda Expressions** (Java 8+): Concise and functional way to create anonymous functions.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- **Java 17** or later (as the code utilizes features from recent versions of Java)
